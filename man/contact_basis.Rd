\description{
This data set contains contact matrices and population data for 176 geographical regions.
The contact matrices uses data provided by the \code{contactdata} package while the population
data is provided by the US Census Bureau.
}
\details{
The contact matrices are provided for each of the four arenas: "Work", "Home", "School", "Other" in
5-year age groups.

The \code{diseasy} SEIR models are configured to use a specific transformation of the contact matrices.
To make the definition of "contact" matrix more clear, lets start with the definitions from this paper:
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754v2.full.pdf

m_ij the raw contact matrix elements from age group i to age group j\cr
c_ij the reciprocal contact matrix elements\cr
w_i  the proportion of population that fall into age group i\cr

The \code{diseasy} SEIR models are configured to use a symmetric, weighted set of
contacts matrices where the elements are 0.5 * (c_ij * w_j + c_ji * w_i)

Since the \code{contactdata} package gives the number of contacts directly (in their
framework, denoted as X_ij), we transform to the above elements through these intermediaries: \cr
m_ij = X_ij / w_j\cr
c_ij = m_ij * w_i = X_ij * w_i / w_j\cr

The population data includes the proportion of the population in these 5-year age groups as well as
information of 1-year age-groups to allow transformation of the contact matrices into other age cuts.

This product uses the Census Bureau Data API but is not endorsed or certified by the Census Bureau.
